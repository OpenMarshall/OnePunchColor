# OnePunchColor

###What is This
<br>Here are 22 different colors, which are compatible with white color, I got these from 《One Punch Man》.
<br>Now you can use these colors in your App, go get them from UIColor or just UIView.
<br>You can download ZIP to see how this works (very simple), or just download file **OnePunchColor.swift**, and use it as follow.
###How to Use

        // quick version
        self.view.punch()
        // slow version
        self.view.punchWithInterval(2)
        // complete version
        self.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.onePunchColor()
