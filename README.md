###What is This
Here are 22 different colors, which are compatible with white color, I got these from 《One Punch Man》.
<br>Now you can use these colors in your App, go get them from UIColor or just UIView.
<br>You can download ZIP to see how this works (very simple), or just download file **OnePunchColor.swift**, and use it as follow.
###How to Use
<code>
self.view.punch() // quick version

self.view.punchWithInterval(2) // slow version

self.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.onePunchColor() // complete version
</code>
